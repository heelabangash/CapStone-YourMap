# CapStone-YourMap

Capstone BrainStation

## Overview

A map of your world. At a glance you will be able to see who you know in what country. When you tap on a country, then a city, you should be able to add what
you want to see there as a list, like national monuments, tourist attractions etc. You should be able to have multiple lists per city/country/continent.

### Problem Space

Our networks of riends and family are distributed all over the world today. It is hard to keep track of in your brain. This app will help you keep track of who you know where. It doubles as a travel bucketlist for things you can do when/if you visit them.

### User Profile

User 1 - Sonia

Sonia has a bestfriend she hasn't seen for 6 years. Her bestfriend Rebecca has a job in which she travels around every few years within the UK. Sonia jots down where her friend is in the yourmap map when she has the chance and references it instead of having to remember. Sonia wants to visit Rebecca in Scotland. She makes a list for Scotland, this list includes travel necessities. Sonia makes a list for Edinbrugh, Aberdeen, and Glasgow, for sites she wants to see when she visits those cities.
